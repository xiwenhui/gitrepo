the biology class is very different. We donâ€™t need to sit in the classroom, because the teacher takes us to do activities. We go to a field that is near our school, and the task for us is to observe flowers. We feel so excited and finish the task very carefully. It is a good way for us to learn knowledge. I am so happy.
